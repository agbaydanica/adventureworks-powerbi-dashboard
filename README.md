# Power BI Project: AdventureWorks Sales Dashboard  

## Project Overview  

This guided project simulates the role of a **Business Intelligence Analyst** at *AdventureWorks*, a global manufacturing company that produces cycling equipment and accessories.  

The management team needed a way to:  
- Track key performance indicators (Sales, Revenue, Profit, Returns)  
- Compare performance across regions  
- Analyze product-level trends  
- Identify high-value customers  

The goal was to transform raw CSV data into actionable insights through a fully interactive **Power BI dashboard**.
